# Performance Analysis of Array Search

This document presents the performance analysis of searching for a random value inside array elements with varying integer distributions.

## Integer Distribution: (-10, 10)

The line chart below shows the relationship between array size and time taken to find a random value inside the array elements with an integer distribution between (-10, 10).
